Important Notes for the implementation:

-The implementation of Trapezoid rule of integration and newton-raphson algorithm is seperated into
two different classes.

-Every evaluation of f(x),f'(x), the summation, and the computed x value is truncated to 5 decimal places
for both of the implementation.

- The function or y is hard-coded under the "Function" function for both of the algorithms. 
You can modify the "Function" function to calculate different function.

-For Newton-Raphson alogirthm, the initial value for x and stopping criteria can be adjusted
in the function call under the main() method of the class

-For trapezoid rule of integration, the upper bound integration, lower bound integration and
number of segments can be adjusted in the function call under the main() of the class
